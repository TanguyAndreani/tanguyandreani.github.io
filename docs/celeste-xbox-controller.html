Celeste is a fun game. I play it on my coding laptop
which happens to be a Macbook Pro running on a M1 chip.
<b>Problem:</b> Celeste can't handle my Xbox wireless controller
as-is.
</p>
</div>

<p>My controller works with other MacOS games, but not this one. And to keep meddling with settings seems futile at this point.</p>

<p>How does Celeste handle controller input? 
By looking at the dynamic libraries shipped alongside Celeste, we should be able to pinpoint the issue.</p>

<p>Go to your Steam library and navigate your game‚Äôs local files from there. App files are just folders with an extension.
Any app file can be unfolded
with a right-click.</p>

<p>Navigating inside the <code>.app</code>, we find that Celeste is an SDL based game. The SDL, for
Simple Directmedia Library is a pretty general and well known library which abstracts
away
graphics hardware, input devices and audio devices among other things.</p>

<p>In our case the SDL is bundled in <code>libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib</code>.</p>

<p>We could try replacing it with a newer release. We hope the API remained stable enough since 2.0.0.</p>

<p>Recent releases of the libSDL for MacOS are only available as <code>SDL.framework/</code> folders, with no
dylib in sight. Luckily, I found that renaming <code>SDL2.framework/Versions/A/SDL2</code> to <code>libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib</code>
does the job. Running both of these files through the <code>file(1)</code> command, we find that they are of the same type.</p>

<p>My first attempt was to inject the newer SDL using the <code>DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES</code> variable. Try it out if you want.</p>

<p>One option remain: to actually modify the game package and replace the old SDL.</p>

<h1 id="codesigning">Codesigning</h1>

<p>Having replaced the file, the game won‚Äôt load anymore. It could be that we‚Äôve just broken it, or maybe
code signing is to blame. By running the command <code>$PATH_TO_CELESTE_APP/Contents/MacOS/Celeste</code> in a terminal,
we get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>System.DllNotFoundException: libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib 
</code></pre>

<p>Since the file <em>is</em> in there, it looks like something bigger is preventing Celeste from loading it. We could
try manually codesigning <code>Celeste.app/</code> and see what happens.</p>

<p>I found that creating a new signing certificate in the OS Keychain and running the following command
will finally make the operating system comply.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>codesign <span class="nt">--deep</span> <span class="nt">--force</span> <span class="nt">--verify</span> <span class="nt">--sign</span> <span class="s2">"MyCert"</span> <span class="nv">$PATH_TO_CELESTE_APP</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Running Celeste again, my wireless controller is instantly recognized without any configuration.</p>
